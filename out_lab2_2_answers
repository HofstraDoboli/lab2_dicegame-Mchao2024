Q1: (cin only) What happens when you run the code above? Explain why
Answer Q1: You enter the requested input and it checks if it fails or passes. 10 passes, 4.5 passes but cuts off .5, and abc and a aren't asked for input. This is because the unread .5 made the loop fail.

Q2: (cin + fail+ignore) What happens when you run the code above? Explain why.
Answer Q2: What happens is the same as the first problem, 10 works fine, 4.5 works but with an unread .5, and abc and a can be entered but there is an error because they are not ints.

Q3: Is the problem of reading an integer value solved? Explain your reasoning.
Answer Q3: No, it is ignored. It accepts 4.5 and makes it an int, which is why it accepts just 4. It tells you there is an error for abc and a because it's not an int.

Q4: (getline only) What happens when you run the code above? Explain why.
Answer Q4: This works the same as before but terminates when a non int is entered (abc). This works because 10 is read as an integer, 4.5 reads as 4 to be an integer, and abc terminates and ends the loop because abc is a non int.

Q5: (getline+stoi) What happens when you run the code above? Explain why.
Answer Q5: The same thing occurs, you enter 10 and its fine, 4.5 is accepted as 4, abc and a have a stoi error and the input remained as 4.

Q6: Explain your method to validate integer values entered
Answer Q6: 10 has no issues so it passes to the else, but to catch 4.5 you check the cin buffer because .5 is left unread, and abc and a trigger the cin.fail.
