        IF playPoint is 7 or 11
            print value playPoint
            print "You won!"
            play equals false

                    roll die1 and die2 again by making new dice 
                    create dieTotal, equal to die1_1 + die2_2 
                    IF playerPoint equals dieTotal
                        print dieTotal
                        print "You won!"
                        rolling equals false 
                    ELSE IF dieTotal equals 7
